## FAQ
### Addon says active time is much lower than played time

The addon tracks a certain percentage of your addon uptime compared to total /played. If it is about seconds or minutes - no problem. If it is about hours - consider rerolling before level 20. After level 20, record the run as instructed by the error message.

this can happen due to: 
- Disconnect or Game crash. This happens due to WoW's WTF folder not updating due to the unexpected end of the game process.
- the Game is killed with alt+f4 or otherwise WITHOUT logging out first (exit game IS NOT THE SAME as logout) 
- the character has been played on two or more computers. Refer to the Multi-pc workaround below

### The addon is missing recorded levels after a DC / Crash

This happens due to WoW's WTF folder not updating due to the unexpected end of the game process. If you happen to have crashes every now and then consider typing /reload every 15min or so when safely out of combat's harm. It will save the process for the addon.

### I checked the accountability tab and there are people A LOT of in red, what do I do?

Close the addon tab and open it again after a minute or so. They should be green now. It takes time to sync at times.

### How can I see how much has been recorded on my character?

```
/dump Hardcore_Character.time_tracked..', '..Hardcore_Character.time_played..', '..Hardcore_Character.tracked_played_percentage
```
